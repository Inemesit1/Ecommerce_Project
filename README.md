# Ecommerce Project: SQL & Python Data Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates the extraction, cleaning, analysis, and visualization of an Ecommerce dataset using **SQL** and **Python**. The dataset contains invoices, product details, customer information, and sales data. The goal is to generate actionable insights, identify trends, and showcase real-world data analytics skills.

**Key Highlights:**
- Data extraction from SQL Server using **PyODBC**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using **Pandas**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Business insights such as revenue trends, top products, and customer behavior

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
- `InvoiceNo`: Unique invoice identifier  
- `Description`: Product description  
- `Quantity`: Number of items per invoice  
- `InvoiceDate`: Date and time of purchase  
- `CustomerID`: Unique customer identifier  
- `Country`: Customer country  
- `StockCode`: Product stock code  
- `UnitPrice`: Price per unit

## Key Analyses & Visualizations
1. **Top 5 Products by Revenue** – Identifying the highest-grossing products  
2. **Revenue by Country** – Understanding which regions generate the most revenue  
3. **Customer Purchase Frequency** – Highlighting repeat customers and one-time buyers  
4. **Monthly Revenue Trends** – Month-over-month revenue growth  
5. **Average Order Value (AOV) & Items per Invoice** – Insights into customer purchasing behavior  
6. **Returned Products Analysis** – Detecting anomalies with negative quantities  
7. **Duplicate Invoice Detection** – Ensuring data quality and integrity  

All visualizations were created in **Python** and are included in this repository.
